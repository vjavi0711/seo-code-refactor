# seo-code-refactor
The first professional portfolio piece wherein we are refactoring to use HTML5 syntax. 
The former code for the Horiseon webpage was unnecesarily long. We were able to consolidate the code and reorganize CSS to make the website more accessible and efficient.
The new code is a lot more concise, which makes it easier to manipulate should one need to, without changing the main display of the actual webpage.
